# POS-Tagger-RB-C-Lex-Yacc
Part of Speech Tagger: Rule-based in C (Lex &amp; Yacc)    
The tagger utilizes a small lexicon and relies on many rules (if-statements) to assign tags.
***This is a simple project for me to get started on NLP***    
- The code will be updated in a different repos. I am getting rid of Lex & Yacc as it is not good at what I wanted to do.    
- Run the bash scrip to build the **_work_** file
